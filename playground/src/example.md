Check file paths and ensure they are correct.

- [Correct File Path](./example2.md)
- [Correct File Path With Correct Fragment](./example2.md#section-1)
- [Incorrect File Path](./missing-file.md)
- [Correct File Path With Incorrect Fragment](./example2.md#missing-section)

Unfortunately, due to CORS issues, the `markdown-links/no-dead-urls` rule 
will always report errors in the [ESLint Online Playground].
